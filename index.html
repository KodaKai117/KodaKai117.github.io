        <p>Hello World!! Today is my second official day of study        in web design, with HTML/CSS.
        I have studied programming on and off for several years, although I have committed extra focus since the lockdown, due to 
         Covid 19.
        I've so far been focused primarily on Python, specifically due to 
        my interest in Artificial Intelligence and Neural Networks.
        It was just one week ago that I re-discovered Khan Academy, after relying much on this site through my University years.
        After some browsing, I immediately began the Introduction to Javascript course. 
      Although I previously had little interest in learning Javascript, I became fascinated with it's versatility, and was delighted to find out that Tensorflow has a Javascript API which allow Neural Networks to run in a browser!</p> <P class="Important">How cool is that!!!</p>

        <p>Hello again! I dragged on in my first post not knowing that this assignment requires a second entry. Maybe I ought to keep it a bit more brief in the future? We will see. Anyway, I'll hopefully keep up with this blog in the future. I think it is a good way for me to document my progress in my programming journey. Until next time!</p>
